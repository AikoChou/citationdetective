To run the models, you will need two dictionaries:
* Sentence dictionary: these are the embeddings for the words in the sentences
* Section dictionary: embeddings for the section titles.

Whatever words or sections are outside these two dictionaries, they will be assigned the UNK embedding. 

All dictionaries in their pickle format can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dlocPHPz6Giv9nS8rR4t6kes8nlJ3inX?usp=sharing

The file format is:
<dict type>_dict_<lan>.pck

Where:
* <dict type> in [word,section]
* <lan> in [en,fr,it]
